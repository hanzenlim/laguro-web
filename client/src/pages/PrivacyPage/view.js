                We generally retain your personal information for as long as is
                necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us
                and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want
                us to use your information to provide Laguro to you, you can
                request that we erase your personal information and close your
                Laguro Account. Please note that if you request the erasure of
                your personal information:

                    We may retain some of your personal information as necessary
                    for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud
                    detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example,
                    if we suspend a Laguro Account for fraud or safety reasons,
                    we may retain certain information from that Account to
                    prevent that User from opening a new Laguro Account in the
                    future.

                    We may retain and use your personal information to the
                    extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For
                    example, Laguro may keep some of your information for tax,
                    insurance, legal reporting, and auditing obligations.

                    Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews) may
                    continue to be publicly visible on Laguro, even after your
                    Laguro Account is cancelled. Additionally, some copies of
                    your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our
                    database.

                    Because we maintain Laguro to protect from accidental or
                    malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your
                    personal information may not be removed from our backup
                    systems for a limited period of time.

                California law permits Users who are California residents to
                request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list
                of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal
                information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the
                prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information
                disclosed to those third parties. See the &ldquo;Contact
                Us&rdquo; section for where to send such requests. Laguro does
                not share personal information with third parties for their own
                direct marketing purposes without your prior consent.
                Accordingly, you can prevent disclosure of your personal
                information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes
                by withholding consent.

                information are firewalls and data encryption, and information
                access controls. If you know or have reason to believe that your
                Laguro Account credentials have been lost, stolen,
                misappropriated, or otherwise compromised or in case of any
                actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Laguro Account,
