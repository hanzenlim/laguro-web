                regulations that apply to their Listings, Host Services, and
                Dental Services. In many cities, Hosts may have to register, get

                Services. Hosts are alone responsible for identifying and
                obtaining any required licenses, permits, insurance, or
                registrations for any Host Services they offer. Certain types of
                Host Services may be prohibited altogether. Penalties may
                include fines or other enforcement. If you have questions about
                how local laws apply to your Listing(s) and Host Service(s) on
                Laguro, you should always seek legal guidance.

                1.1 The Laguro Platform is an online marketplace that connects
                dentists who own a practice (Hosts) to open their clinic space
                for practitioners (Dentists) to rent on an hourly or daily
                basis. This will be complemented by a virtual office platform
                that allows Dentists to access Laguro&rsquo;s proprietary EHR
                system and billing and lab services without the need for
                additional staff, third party contracts, or other connections.
                Host Services may include the offering of clinic space,
                equipment, supplies, staff, or other properties for use. The
                Laguro Platform also allows Patients to create appointments with
                Dentists for the purpose of receiving Dental Services from the
                selected Dentist.{' '}

                1.2 As the provider of the Laguro Platform, Laguro does not own,
                create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver,
                or supply any Listings or Services. Hosts and Dentists alone are
                responsible for their Listings and Services. When Hosts and
                Dentists make or accept a booking, they are entering into a
                contract directly with each other. Laguro is not and does not
                become a party to or other participant in any contractual
                relationship between the Host, Dentist, and Patient. Laguro is
                not a real estate broker. Laguro is not acting as an agent in
                any capacity for any User.

                1.3 While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes,
                Laguro has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the
                existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any
                Listings or Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing
                descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other User Content (as
                defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct of any User
                or third party. Laguro does not endorse any User, Listing or
                Services. Any references to a User being "verified" (or similar
                language) only indicate that the User has completed a relevant
                verification or identification process and nothing else. Images
                are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a
                User or Listing at the time the photograph was taken, and are
                therefore not an endorsement by Laguro of any Host or Listing.

                1.4 If you choose to use the Laguro Platform as a Host or
                Dentist, your relationship with Laguro is limited to being an
                independent, third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent,
                joint venturer or partner of Laguro for any reason, and you act
                exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not
                on behalf, or for the benefit, of Laguro. Laguro does not, and
                shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in
                your performance under these Terms specifically, including in
                connection with your provision of the Services. You acknowledge
                and agree that you have complete discretion whether to list
                Services or otherwise engage in other business or employment
